The **Precision Assembler** is a high-precision manufacturing device that follows instructions from an Assembly Scheme.
|[text]{mb:"II:PrecisionAssembler"}|

# details
In order to work, the **Precision Assembler** requires an [Assembly Scheme], [Precision Tools], [crafting ingredients] and, of course, [electricity].<br>
The machine has a single item port on both of its sides.  
The [input port] *will only accept ingredients marked by the currently installed scheme*.  
The [output port] will automatically output to an adjacent container.

# schemes
Just like an [engineer follows a blueprint during work](blueprints), the **Precision Assembler** is guided by an Assembly Scheme.<br><br>
|[crafting]{source:"assembly_scheme"}|
<br>
The [scheme] can be installed through the user interface by placing it in the middle slot.

# tools
Depending on the scheme the manufacturing process requires different tools, these tools ware down over time and will need replacement.
