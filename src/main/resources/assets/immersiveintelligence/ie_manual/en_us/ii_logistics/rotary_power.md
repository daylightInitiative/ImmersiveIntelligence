# torque and speed
Rotary power is an old-fashioned alternative to electric power. Instead of wires and connectors, wheels and motor belts are used. The power system utilizes 2 factors: torque - in TU (Torque Unit) and speed in DPT (Degrees per Tick). Machines require different torque and speed to work effectively. Devices like the [Sawmill](Sawmill.md) and the [Mechanical Pump](mechanicalpump.md) uses mechanical power.

# torque and speed 2
If any of those values surpasses the limit, the machine explodes. Power can be merged and split using [Gearboxes](rotary_power.md#gearboxes),

# transmissions

The Transmission Boxes are used to connect mechanical devices using a different standard of axles, they can be used to connect a windmill or a waterwheel to a motor belt network or output mechanical energy to a dynamo.

# gearboxes
|[crafting]{source:"gearbox"}|
The Gearboxes are used to link multiple wheels together, their sides can be changed to input, output or nothing. Input torque from all inputs is summed and then divided equally between all outputs. You can use the gearbox to merge torque to make it higher or divide it between 2 or more wheels.

# wheels
|[crafting]{source:"wheels"}|
The wheel is used to transfer mechanical (rotary) power between devices. After placing, it can be connected to another wheel using a motor belt, the same way connectors are linked with wires.

# belts
|[crafting]{source:"belt"}|
The motor belts are the main transmission element of every rotary power network. They differ with the amount of torque and speed they can transfer. If the torque is too high for the belt, it will detach from the wheel and fall onto the ground. Use different materials for different needs.

# gears
|[item_display]{source:"gears"}|
Gears can be used to change the ratio for Torque and Speed for [Gearboxes](rotary_power.md#gearboxes).
