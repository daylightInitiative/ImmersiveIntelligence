Skycrate System
Same Day Delivery

# intro
The Skycrate system is a different approach on delivering items. Its speed surpasses any conveyor, and the usage of rope makes it cheaper and more space-efficient. There are also drawbacks however; it requires stations on both sides and a number of posts depending on the length of the system. Skycrates are a better option than conveyors on longer distances, and is not encouraged to use them for short (0-30m) distances.

The Skycrate station is both the starting and stopping point of the delivery system. To form it, use a hammer on the scaffolding in the middle.
To function, it requires rotary power to be inputted to its side

# details_crate
The amount of gears increase its efficiency, similar how it works with [Gearboxes](rotary_power.md#gearboxes)
The station uses mounts to put crates into the delivery system. The mounts are taken from the back, behind the inserter. The crates are inserted and outputted on the conveyor. A crate can be forced out of the station by applying a redstone signal.

# details_cart
Like its Skycrate counterpart, the station uses mounts to put the contents of the carts into the delivery system. minecrafts can only enter the station when the railway barrier is up. A minecraft can be forced out of the station by applying a redstone signal. The station will automatically expel minecarts after a loading/unloading operation.


# skycrate_post
|[multiblock]{mb:"II:SkycratePost"}|
The Skycrate Post is the relay between two points in the skycrate network. Only two wires can be attached to the pylon at the same time. To form it, use a hammer on the fence


# minecarts
|[item_display]{source:"minecart_general"}|
Crate carts are a safe way to transport items via rail. They can be crafted by putting a crate into a minecart. Items inside said crates will not be lost. When disassembled, the minecart will split into the cart and the crate

The Skycrate mounts are used to transport crates via the zipline. There are two models: The basic ones and the electric ones, which use energy provided on the way via nearby **Tesla Coils**.
