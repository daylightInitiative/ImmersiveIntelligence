# intro
|[crafting]{source:"medical"}|
The Medical Crate is a device used for healing wounded entities. After being placed it has to be filled with basic Regeneration Potions to work.

# details_1
Sneaking and right clicking will open or close the crate: when it's closed - its inventory can be accessed, when it's open - right click to receive the effects. The Medical Crate can also apply an "Iron Will" boost effect, increasing mobility and focus while firing weapons while the move called. To gain it, the second slot has to be filled with Golden Apples.

# details_2
An inserter can be installed on top of the crate. To do it, use the wrench on a closed crate and select the appropriate upgrade. After being installed, the crate requires a MV or LV power wire connected directly to it. The installed syringe inserter will automatically heal and give boost to entities around.
