**The Emplacement** is a heavy defensive structure used for protecting the perimeter of your factory. To form it use a hammer on the upper middle sandbag block.
# 1
An **Emplacement** can defend a vast amount of fields depending on what module that is installed.  
Emplacements do not have an [emplacements weapons](emplacement_weapons) installed by default. Instead, the weapon is assembled on the emplacement using the Wrench. 
When interacting with a wrench, you have a selection of modules to install, each requiring their own resources to be built. Upon selecting the weapon, you need to assemble it by interacting with the emplacement using the Wrench and have all the items.
# 2
The **Emplacement** requires electricity, ammunition and by default a redstone signal in order to operate. If the redstone signal is cut off, the weapon will retract back into the emplacement.

The different weapons requires different types of ammunition, such as the [Autocannon](emplacement_weapons.md#flak0) requires a heavier caliber than the [Machinegun Nest](emplacement_weapons.md#mg0)
# 3
**Emplacement** weapons can be damaged and automatically repaired. You can set up the minimal threshold of the emplacement weapon’s health before it goes into repair state.<br>During repair, it will hide inside the Emplacement and will not react to commands. Note that Emplacements can be destroyed if enough damage is inflicted to the gun itself, which also means that you will lose resources used to construct it.
# 4
Emplacements allow storing up to *4 target filtering tasks*. Each task has 3 basic groups on which it filters the entity. The first one is the Type: a mob, animal, vehicle or shell, additional parameters (id) can be specified. The second is a name and the third is a team. The parameters within a group are joined using OR and then AND with other groups. For example: select all mobs or animals from team “a” and “b” with name “c”.
