The Machinegun is a pioneering, sophisticated new invention, that allows effective defense against all sorts of threats. Unlike most manned weapons, the machine gun can not be fired on the go. In order to fire it has to be displaced on a block with enough space.

The MG uses magazines, which can be loaded with bullets in the [Packer](packer.md). While firing bullets, casings drop on the ground to be picked. The MG is prone to overheating, which depends on the firing rate. The gun like most modern-day equipment allows for different configurations using [Upgrades](weapon_upgrades), such as water cooling, scopes, change of bipod and more.
