The Submachine gun, often referred to as the SMG, is an infantry weapon designed for close-to-medium range engagements. 
The submachine gun is relatively cheap to manufacture and produce ammo for, making it an ideal choice for close combat, which requires fast-paced maneuvers and high rate of fire.

SMG can be modified to accept drum magazines and can have a <link;revolver;§o§nbayonet§r;2> attached to it, enabling melee during close range engagements. 
To improve aiming speed a [folding stock](weapon_upgrades.md#14) can be installed. To eliminate the loud gunshot noises, which can attract enemies around, a [suppressor](weapon_upgrades.md#12) upgrade can be installed. 
On the opposite, the barrel can be exchanged for a noisier, but higher-velocity (and because of that - better penetration) [sturdy barrel](weapon_upgrades.md#11).

Keep in mind that the Submachinegun loses its accuracy with the distance to the target. It is advised to use Railguns or Artillery Weapons long range engagements instead.
