The flagpole keeps 8 surrounding chunks loaded along with the one it's placed in, it does not require any resources to
do so. Its another function is a display for banners in form of a flag. To place a banner use it on one of the
wooden pole blocks. If you have decided to invade someone else's property or just want to update your banner design, you
can remove the placed banner by using wire cutters.
