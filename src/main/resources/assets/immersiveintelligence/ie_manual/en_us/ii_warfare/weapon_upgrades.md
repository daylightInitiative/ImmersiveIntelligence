Weapon Upgrades
Not broken? Not enough features

# 0
Versatility and adaptability is most crucial in an ever-changing conflict. With this information kept in mind, the clever engineers who have designed and perfected the modern arsenal has left room for personalizing and modifying the weapons with arguments.

# 1
|[crafting]{source:"heavy_barrel"}|
The heavy barrel allows the weapon to shoot at a faster fire rate at the cost of lower accuracy.

# 2
|[crafting]{source:"water_cooling"}|
With new technology comes new challenges, the machine guns fast firing causes friction in the barrel. The heat can cause the material of the weapon to be damaged.
To tackle this problem, a **water cooling system** can be installed. Inside the water jacket runs a tube where water runs to cool the barrel. A **Bottling Machine** can refill the water.

# 3 
|[crafting]{source:"belt_fed_loader"}|
The **Belt fed loader**, is a way to minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition apparatus to the entire weapon system, and allow high rates of continuous fire without needing frequent magazine changes.

The ammunition needs to be provided through an [ammunition crate](ammocrate.md#main).

# 4
|[crafting]{source:"second_magazine"}|
The **Second magazine** installment allows the machine gun to load a second magazine for the double capacity of rounds and still mobile.

To load the second magazine equip it to your off-hand.

# 5
|[crafting]{source:"hasty_bipod"}|
The **Filed bipod** it's a lightweight and quite to be honest a hasty contraption, but due to its simple design it's easy to set up.
The drawbacks with the almost weightless bipod is the weapon becomes more prone to recoil.

# 6
|[crafting]{source:"precise_bipod"}|
The **Precision bipod**. Crafted from a sturdier metal allows for a reduced recoil, but because the heavier and more complex component the time to deploy the gun will be increased.

# 7
|[crafting]{source:"scope"}|
A **Scope** is an easy way to increase the accuracy and get better shots at a target far away.

# 8
|[crafting]{source:"ir_scope"}|
The **Infrared scope** is an upgraded version of its predecessor, which can also provide night vision using the infrared reflector and a special filter, to work it requires energy provided by a capacitor backpack.

# 9
|[crafting]{source:"shield"}|
**Shields** is a simple yet effective to give extra protection to the gunner. 
The shield will add to the time to deploy the machine gun. They can resist a limited amount of projectiles, and will be broken if too much damage is taken. Shield's resistance is regenerated over time, if not taken damage.

# 10
|[crafting]{source:"tripod"}|
The **Tripod** is a replacement for the stock machine gun bipod. It increases the horizontal firing angle to 165 degrees and almost removes the recoil. 
It is heavy and slow to set up, this makes it an ideal choice for static defence.

# 11
|[crafting]{source:"sturdy_barrel"}|
The **Sturdy barrel** is a modification, which increases the gun's accuracy and bullet velocity in cost of the gun's firing rate.

# 12
|[crafting]{source:"suppressor"}|
The **Suppressor** makes the gunshot noises almost silent, perfect for ambushes and infiltration. It doesn't influence firing speed nor penetration.

# 13
|[crafting]{source:"bottom_loader"}|
The **Bottom loader** upgrade moves the magazine loading mechanism from the right side to the bottom, replacing the wooden fore-grip. This enables both stick and drum magazines to be loaded.

# 14
|[crafting]{source:"folding_stock"}|
The **Folding stock** makes the submachinegun more compact and decreases the time taken to aim down sights. Perfect for paratroopers and special forces.

# 15
|[crafting]{source:"rifle_grenade_launcher"}|
The **Rifle Grenade Launcher** allows your Assault rifle to shoot Railgun Grenades, albeit at a significantly lower range compared to the Railgun,
