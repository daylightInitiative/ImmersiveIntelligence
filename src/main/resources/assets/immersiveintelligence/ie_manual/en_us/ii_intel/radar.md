Radar is the large detection device, capable of detecting entities in a direct line over incredibly long distances, including (and especially) all metal objects and artillery shells. 
To form it use a hammer on the left wooden scaffolding block.

Radar has multiple uses. It can be linked with emplacement weapons, such as the CPDS and used to intercept projectiles at long ranges. It can also be linked with the Strategic Command Table [WIP].
If upgraded with Triangulators, the radar can also detect radio signals within its range and determine their location, this allows ambushing unsuspecting enemies with precise artillery strikes. In order to operate the Radar requires a constant supply of electricity.
