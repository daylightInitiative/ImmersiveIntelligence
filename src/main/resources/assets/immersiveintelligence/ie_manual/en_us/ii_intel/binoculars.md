Information is best gather when the observed target don't notice your activity, for when a target don't know that they are observed they will act natural.

This can be done in a variety of ways, one being infiltration and espionage on a more personal level.
But the safest option of them all is observation from afar.

Utilizing the optical phenomenon of refraction and lenses observation from a far can be done by ease.
By using the same method as the precision scope and a metal binding, a **Binoculars** can be constructed.

# 2
The **Binoculars** are used by *sneaking*, and with the new research in optical mechanics and multiple lenses the ability to zoom on command makes for a great recon device.

When you are extending you vision the orientation can be hard to keep track on, for your peripheral vision is blocked by
the **Binoculars**.
To not get disorientated when using the device a small gyroscope has been installed to indicate your yaw in degrees.

The **Infrared Binoculars** is a more advanced version of the accustomed **Binoculars**. They have cutting edge technology in
optics and electronics to make it possible to see with minimal reflections of light. The **Infrared Binoculars** excels at intelligence gathering in the dark vail of the night.

# 4
But with new technology comes new responsibility. Because the way the lenses let in big quantity of light the **Infrared Binoculars** should be **cautioned against** to turn on in *broad daylight*.

The **Infrared Binoculars** runs on power and if no power is supplied the night vision cant be toggled on. If combined with the capacitor backpack the device can be charged on the move.
