The coagulator is a machine used to coagulate latex and form raw rubber balls for further processing. To form it use a hammer on the middle sheetmetal block on machine's back.

# coagulator usage
The coagulator requires a supply of electricity to its heavy connector port and a steady supply of latex (right tank) and formic acid (left tank), take note that the sides swap if the machine is flipped.

# coagulator usage 2
After latex is mixed with the acid and the upper "quark" layer forms, the crane will pick one of the buckets, submerge it and put it back while a timer is automatically set. After some time, the latex will solidify into raw rubber, which will be outputted by a mechanism holding the bucket. The rubber will be dropped onto the ground.
