Vehicle Workshop
Beginning of the Joyride

# intro
|[multiblock]{mb:"II:VehicleWorkshop"}|
Industrial progress brings new means of transportation, replacing traditional ones, like horses. The Vehicle Workshop enables you to create these new means, most notably the [Motor Bike](motor_bike.md). To form it, use a hammer on the left aluminium scaffolding.

# making_vehicles
The machine requires **Petroleum**, **Diesel** or **Biodiesel** along with electricity to run, these can be provided using the appropriate ports on machine's side and top. To create a vehicle - select an appropriate option through the interface, provide shown materials and make sure no vehicle is parked on the platform. If all the conditions are met, press the striped button in the interface and the workshop will start assembling your vehicle.

# fuel
If the vehicle uses fuel, it will be refueled half-way using the workshop's internal tank. The fuel will not last for long, so consider building a [Fuel Station](fuel_station.md).

# upgrades
Existing vehicles can also be upgraded. To apply an upgrade, drive your vehicle onto the platform and select valid upgrades through the interface. Upgrading and removing upgrades requires power and diesel to be supplied.
