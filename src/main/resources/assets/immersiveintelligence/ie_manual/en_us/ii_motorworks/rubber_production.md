Rubber Production
Happy Little Trees

# rubber_trees
he first step in rubber production is finding and gathering saplings of the **Rubber Trees** found in the jungle biome. These trees are a valuable source of latex - a white fluid, which is the main component of industrial rubber. 
The second step is creating a rubber plantation, when the tree saplings are grown, carve the extraction hole log using an axe.

Then place a latex collector next to the tree and use a bucket on a collector to make it gather latex.
If more than one collector is next to the tree, the latex will be split between all of them. When the bucket is full, interact with the collector to regain it.

# chemical_steps
To start coagulating latex into raw rubber two things are needed: **formic acid** and [Coagulator](coagulator.md). To produce formic acid a [Refinery](refinery.md) is required. Combine Carbon Monoxide with Methanol to create Formic Acid.
Carbon monoxide can be produced through electrolysis of carbon dioxide, a pollutant and byproduct collected by the **Carbon Dioxide Filter**
Methanol can be produced by mixing nickel or platinum with hydrogen, created through electrolysis of water. The last step is to combine both using the [Refinery](refinery.md).


# processing
When latex and formic acid are acquired, it's time for some coagulation. Use the machine to create **raw rubber balls** and then press them into sheets using a plate mold in the [Metal Press](metalpress.md). The last step is vulcanization of raw rubber sheets. Use the [Vulcanizer](vulcanizer.md) to produce rubber tires or belts.
