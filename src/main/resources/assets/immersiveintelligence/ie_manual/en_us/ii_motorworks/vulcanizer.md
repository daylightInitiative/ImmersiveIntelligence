Vulcanizer
The Overengineered Smoke Dispenser

# intro
|[multiblock]{mb:"II:Vulcanizer"}|
The Vulcanizer is the final machine in the [Rubber Production](rubber_production.md) process. To form it use a hammer on the steel block nearest to the tank.

# production
Using heat, pressure, molds and set of additional compounds, the Vulcanizer transforms raw rubber sheets into a familiar industrial rubber, which is used to construct many new machines, most notably faster conveyors, more efficient motor belts and is vital to wheeled vehicle production. To process rubber 3 ingredients are required: raw rubber sheets, provided to the upper port on the iron container, vulcanization compound - provided to the port below and sulfur - inputted into the steel tank.

# molds
To operate the machine, the vulcanizer requires a mold, which determines the final output and electricity usage.

Vulcanizer molds can be created in the [Engineers Workbench](engineers_workbench.md) using the blueprint above.

# vulcanizer compounds

The Vulcanization compound consists of additives which improve rubber's properties. It can be crafted in 2 ways.
